# Whiley2APRON
This project is built on top of APRON library to evaluate whether Octagon domains can be used to analyze Whiley programs. APRON library (http://apron.cri.ensmp.fr/library/) provides C/Ocaml implementations (experimental Java interface) to find the bugs in the program by switching off different abstract interpretation-based numerical domains (e.g. octagon domain). This program aims to use Java APIs of APRON library to perform static analysis on Whiley programs and compare the performance of different domains.
