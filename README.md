# Whiley2APRON
This is a simple project to check whether APRON library can be used to check Whiley programs. APRON library (http://apron.cri.ensmp.fr/library/) provides C/Ocaml implementations (experimental Java interface) to analyze the programs and find the bugs by using abstract interpretation-based numerical domains (e.g. octagon domain). This project aims to use this libraray and analyze the Whiley program using different domains.
