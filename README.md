# Whiley2APRON
This project is built on top of APRON library to check that Octagon domains can be used to analyze Whiley programs. APRON library (http://apron.cri.ensmp.fr/library/) provides C/Ocaml implementations (experimental Java interface) to find the bugs in the program and faciliate the changes of different abstract numerical domains (e.g interval/ octagon domain). This project aims to integrate APRON library (via JNI or native Java APIs) to perform static analysis on Whiley programs and compare the performance of different domains.
